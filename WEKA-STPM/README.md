WEKA for Moving Object Data Analysis and Mining (Weka-STPM)

Weka-STPM extends "Weka to support automatic trajectory data preprocessing to add semantic information to raw trajectory data for analysis and mining." In short, it supports two Stop and Move of Trajectories (SMOT) algorithms, IB-SMOT (ACMGIS 2007) and CB-SMOT (ACMSAC 2008). SMOT algorithms are pretty neat. They work well on spatial data because they exploit properties that are characteristically spatial i.e. speed, direction, etc.

This github project is a port of the original Weka-STPM that takes care of some bugbears in the code-base and provides compatibility with PostGIS 2.X. For this reason I encourage you to download Weka STPM from this github project (by cloning or clicking on "Download Zip" on the right. Links to the authors are listed below:
